    "[OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) is an online Machine Learning (ML) experiments database accessible to everyone for free. The core idea is to have a single repository of datasets and results of ML experiments on them. Despite having gained a lot of popularity in recent years, with a plethora of tools now available, the numerous ML experimentations continue to happen in silos and not necessarily as one whole shared community.\n",

In the example script below, we are going to load the Iris dataset available with scikit-learn, use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate a Random Forest of 10 trees. Sounds trivial enough and is indeed less than 10 lines of code."

    "A simple script and we achieve a mean accuracy of **95.33%**. That was easy. It is really amazing how far we have come with ML tools that make it easy to get started. As a result, we have hundreds of thousands of people working with these tools every day. That inevitably leads to the reinvention of the wheel. The tasks that each individual ML practitioner performs often have significant overlaps and can be omitted by reusing what someone from the community has done already. At the end of the day, we didn't build a Random Forest model all the way from scratch. We gladly reused code written by generous folks from the community. The special attribute of our species is the ability to work as a collective wherein our combined intellect becomes larger than the individual sum of parts. Why not do the same for ML? I mean, can I see what other ML practitioners have done to get better scores on the Iris dataset?\n",

Runs can then pair any such task and flow to construct an ML *workflow* and return the evaluated scores. This approach can help us define such components one-time, and we can extend this for any combination of a dataset, model, and for any number of evaluations in the future. Imagine if the entire ML *community* defines such tasks and various simple to complicated flows that they use in their daily practice. We can build custom working ML pipeline and even get to compare performances of our techniques on the same *task* with others! OpenML aims exactly for that.

That is certainly better than the naive model we built at the beginning to achieve **95.33%**.
